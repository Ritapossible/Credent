"""GenLayer contract layer for the reputation oracle.

This file is the *shell*: everything that talks to the chain, and nothing that
decides a number. `build_contract.py` splices the deterministic engine
(`reputation_core.py`) and the prompt builder (`reputation_prompts.py`) into the
marker below and writes `reputation_oracle.py`, which is the single file that
actually deploys. Editing the generated file directly is a mistake - it is
overwritten, and `test_build_contract.py` fails when it drifts.

The split is deliberate. The engine is 245 tests of pure integer arithmetic that
runs with no GenLayer runtime present; the shell cannot be unit-tested at all
without the GenVM, because `from genlayer import *` only resolves inside it.
Keeping the untestable part small and free of arithmetic is what stops the
untestable part from being where a scoring bug hides.

Three contract-layer decisions worth stating, because none of them are obvious
from the engine:

**Storage is flat.** `Policy` and `Report` are frozen dataclasses, which are not
storage types, so the ten policy fields are stored as individual `u256` and a
`Policy` is rebuilt in memory per call. Attestations are parallel `DynArray`s
indexed by a shared integer id rather than a `DynArray` of structs, because that
needs `gl.storage.inmem_allocate` and the parallel form uses only constructs
whose semantics are unambiguous. It is less pretty and it is the version I can
reason about without a runtime to check me against.

**Grading uses `run_nondet`, not `eq_principle.prompt_comparative`.** The
engine already ships the exact comparison this needs: `grades_agree` allows a
numeric tolerance per graded field, and `errors_agree` classifies failures so
validators agree about *failing* too. Asking an LLM to judge whether two JSON
grades are "equivalent" would throw that precision away and put a second
non-deterministic judgement inside the consensus step.

**Money moves on explicit calls only.** A slashed bond stays with the contract; a
releasable one is reclaimed by the attester after the lock elapses. Nothing
transfers implicitly during grading, so a failed nondet round cannot strand or
duplicate a payment.

One warning about the SDK, because it cost a full rewrite to learn. Two
generations of `py-genlayer` are in circulation and they disagree about most of
the names below. This file is written against the generation the pinned runner
loads (std lib `11rhn002...`): `from genlayer import *` exposing a `gl` proxy,
`gl.Contract`, `gl.vm.run_nondet`, `gl.vm.UserError` (a dataclass with
`.message`), `gl.message_raw["datetime"]`, and `gl.get_contract_at(addr)
.emit_transfer(value=...)`. The other generation spells those
`import genlayer as gl`, `gl.contract.Contract`, `run_nondet_default`,
`UserError.immediate` / `.data`, `gl.message.raw`, and `gl.chain.Account`. The
published API reference at sdk.genlayer.com documents the second set plus a
`gl.vm.get_timestamp` that exists in neither. Check names against the extracted
std library and `genvm-lint check`, never against the website.
